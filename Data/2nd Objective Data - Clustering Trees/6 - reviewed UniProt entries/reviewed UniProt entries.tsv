Involved, among others, in the transcriptional regulation of genes that are responsible for rhamnolipid surfactant biosynthesis (PubMed:8144472, PubMed:7604006, PubMed:14526008). Acts by binding to a specific sequence in the rhlAB regulatory region, both in the presence and in the absence of its autoinducer (PubMed:14526008). In the former case it activates transcription of the promoter, whereas in the latter it acts as a transcriptional repressor (PubMed:14526008). Also regulates the expression of the rmlBDAC operon, encoding dTDP-L-rhamnose biosynthetic enzymes, by binding to the rml box in the promoter region (PubMed:22262098). In addition, is involved in the regulation of the production of elastase (lasB) and pyocyanine (PubMed:8144472, PubMed:7604006, PubMed:8522523). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14526008, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15576196, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22262098, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7494482, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7604006, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8144472, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8522523}.
